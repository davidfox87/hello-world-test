# Demo of Jenkins-Docker-NGINX setup for CI/CD 


Jenkins offers a simple way to set up a continuous integration or continuous delivery environment for 
almost any combination of languages and source code repositories using pipelines, as well as automating 
other routine development tasks. While Jenkins doesnâ€™t eliminate the need to create scripts for individual steps, 
it does give you a faster and more robust way to integrate your entire chain of build, test, and 
deployment tools than you can easily build yourself.
